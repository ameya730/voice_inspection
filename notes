Steps that need to be incorporated

The inspection should be station wise (also one final PDI option should be given at the end)
Once the VIN has been scanned send the VIN and the station from where the VIN has been scanned. 
In SUPABASE check if this VIN has been scanned for this station or not. 
If yes, then indicate a response accordingly.

At the dashboard level also this logic needs to be changed.
